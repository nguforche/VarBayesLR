# VarBayesLR
A package for variational Bayes inference of the logistic regression. See [1][2] for details. 

## Why Use VarBayesLR
  - simple and fast 
  - scalable 
  - can improve prediction accuracy
  - provide efficient variable relevance or importance  
 
## How to get Started? 
Install via devtools: 

```sh
> devtools::install_github("nguforche/VarBayesLR")
```
